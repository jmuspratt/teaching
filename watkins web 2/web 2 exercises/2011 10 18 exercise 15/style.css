/* In HTML5, we can demand the user fill out certain fields by using the "required" attribute. (With current browsers we would still have to use Javascript to actually stop the form from being submitted if it hasn't been filled out).

Target all inputs that have an attribute of "required" and give them a 1px solid red border */
