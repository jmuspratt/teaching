// We'll use the print function to output strings of text.
// Strings need to be surrounded by quotation marks. 
// Notice that every PHP statement ends with a semi-colon.

print "Here is some text in double quotes.";

print "\n"; // add a hard return (aka a new line) to the output

print "Here's some text in double quotes, with an apostrophe in the string.";
print "\n"; 

// "escaping double quotes"
print "Here's some text in double quotes, with \"air quotes\" in the string.";
print "\n"; 


print 'Here is some text in single quotes.';
print "\n"; 

// "escaping" an apostrophe character (same as a single quote in ASCII)
print 'Here\'s some text in single quotes, with an apostrophe in the string.'; 
print "\n";


print 'Here is some text in single quotes, with "air quotes" in the string.';
print "\n";

//------------------
// EXERCISE

// Using the print function, output the following string *twice* to the Terminal. Write two lines of PHP: the first should put the whole string in double quotes, the second should put the whole string in single quotes. Both lines should output the same text. Only escape characters where you need to avoid a PHP error.
