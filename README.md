Teaching

Syllabi and exercise files from my web courses.

From Spring 2011 through Spring 2012, I taught a three-semester web design sequence at [Watkins College of Art, Design & Film](http://watkins.edu), emphasizing a hands-on approach in which visual design ideas and programming concepts could inform each other. The students started with the fundamentals of standards-based markup and gradually took on advanced CSS, responsive design, jQuery, PHP, and Wordpress templating.
