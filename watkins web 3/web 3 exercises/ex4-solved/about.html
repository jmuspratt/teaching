				<p>	<img src="images/nash1.jpg" alt="Nashville" /> By 1860, when the first rumblings of secession began to be heard across the South, antebellum Nashville was a very prosperous city. The city&#8217;s significance as a shipping port made it a desirable prize as a means of controlling important river and railroad transportation routes. In February 1862, Nashville became the first state capital to fall to Union troops. The Battle of Nashville (December 15â€“16, 1864) was a significant Union victory and perhaps the most decisive tactical victory gained by either side in the war.</p>

				<p><img class="right" src="images/nash11.jpg" alt="Nashville" />Within a few years after the Civil War the city had reclaimed its important shipping and trading position and also developed a solid manufacturing base. The post-Civil War years of the late 19th century brought a newfound prosperity to Nashville. These healthy economic times left the city with a legacy of grand classical-style buildings, which can still be seen around the downtown area.</p>

				<p>Since the 1970s, the city has experienced tremendous growth, particularly during the economic boom of the 1990s under the leadership of then-Mayor and later-Tennessee Governor, Phil Bredesen, who made urban renewal a priority, and fostered the construction or renovation of several city landmarks, including the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, the downtown Nashville Public Library, the Bridgestone Arena, and LP Field.</p>

				<p>In 1997 Nashville was awarded an <span class="caps">NHL</span> expansion team which was subsequently named the Nashville Predators. LP Field (formerly Adelphia Coliseum) was built after the National Football League&#8217;s (<span class="caps">NFL</span>) Houston Oilers agreed to move to the city in 1995. The <span class="caps">NFL</span> team debuted in Nashville in 1998 at Vanderbilt Stadium, and LP Field opened in the summer of 1999. The Oilers changed their name to the Tennessee Titans and saw a season culminate in the Music City Miracle and a close Super Bowl game that came down to the last play.</p>

				<p>Today, the city along the Cumberland River is a crossroads of American culture, and one of the fastest-growing areas of the Upland South.</p>
