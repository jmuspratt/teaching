<p><strong>Make the following changes to the text below using TextWrangler. You may only edit the CSS.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Change the size of the browser window to see the behavior of the elements on this page. Notice that the second paragraph has been been given a purple background and semi-transparency. It also has <em>absolute positioning</em>: it is being pulled out of the normal document flow, and its top and left coordinates (50 px each) refer to the upper-left corner of the browser window. Modify the CSS rule to position the purple <code>p#second</code> paragraph flush with the top of the browser window, but still 50px from the left edge.</li>
	
<li>Write a CSS rule for <code>p#first</code> based on the one you have for <code>p#second</code> (just copy and paste). Give <code>p#first</code> a different background color and modify the rule to place it flush to the <em>top right</em> corner of the browser</li>

<li>Now do the same procedure for p#third (give it another background color) and place its bottom left edge 10 px (both left and right) from the <em>bottom left</em> of the browser window </li>

<li>Do the same procedure a last time for p#fourth (give it another background color) and place its bottom right edge 10 px (both left and right) from the <em>bottom right</em> of the browser window </li>

<li>Now, with a single line of CSS, figure out how to make all the paragraphs get positioned with reference to the main (yellow) div, not the browser window. (Big hint: look at Exercise 6). Change the browser window size to confirm the paragraphs are attached to the main div.</li>
